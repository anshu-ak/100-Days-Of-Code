<li>Read the original article: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4/">Join the #100DaysOfCode</a></li>
<li><em>Plan: Formulate what you want to work on during the challenge</em>. It might be - learning a framework, or starting a journey of learning to code, or improving your skill level with a particular technology or a programming language. Don&rsquo;t spend too much time planning, but having a plan like this will help you on your path. <!-- ADD MORE HERE LATER - with a link to a separate page. --></li>
<li>From today on, for the next 100 days, tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="steps-to-increase-the-likelihood-of-success">Steps to increase the likelihood of success</h3>

<ul>
<li>Check out other <a href="/resources">resources</a></li>
<li>(Optional, but highly recommended) Fork <a href="https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code">this Github repo</a> and commit to the Log daily. Follow the instructions in the repo.</li>
<li>Follow 100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot that retweets all the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It&rsquo;s a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks @amanhimself for creating it!</li>
<li>Important: Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It&rsquo;s also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (probably more :) ) right away.</li>
<li>If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)</li>
</ul>
